# Example Dataset

Example data can be downloaded by running `./download.sh`, and all subcommands can be tested using `./run.sh`. Output is written to the `out` directory, and expected output can be found in the `expected_out` directory (excluding BAMs and other large files).

Each subcommand should take a few seconds to run, and the whole script should complete within a minute or two. The final command runs `uncalled4 browser` which starts a local server which can be viewed at `localhost:8000`, which can be exited by entering `Ctrl-C` on the terminal.
